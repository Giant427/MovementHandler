Hello fellow Developers!!

## What is MovementHandler?

Today I am releasing my first open-source module, the MovementHandler!! Making things like Crouch, Sprint, Slide, PRone can be easy but kind of boring at the same time(because it's easy). It is used very frequently in a lot of games. I am working on a FPS Framework as well, and I hadn't really planned to make this, but my ego ate me up and I couldn't bear watching games having these abilities but my framework not. So I took some time and made this. It is very very easy to use, and if you have some quality animations, you could get quite a lot out of this. 

## How to use it?

In the [Roblox Model](https://www.roblox.com/library/7933550317/MovementHandler), there are 3 `Folders`:
- `ReplicatedStorage`
- `ServerScriptService`
- `StarterPlayerScripts`

By defualt, the script expects the folders to go to their respective directories like this:

To use the animations provided in the Script itself, you will have to upload the animations to your account and then replace the `AnimationId`s in the `Animation` objects accordingly.

The script automatically adjusts if the character dies and respawns.

## Keybinds
- Sprint - `LeftShift`
- Crouch - `C`
- Slide - `C`
- Prone - `C`
